<h3>DroneDome is working on a next-gen solution for effectively protecting troops and assets from unmanned attacks.</h3>

<h3>Our philosophy:</h3>

    ul {
        padding-left: 2em;
    }
</style>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Our first priority is to be easy to use and quick to set up. We support the SAPIENT standard.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Our equipment is made to be sit in the mud for 2 weeks and still work.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> If users will need the help of our system, we do our best so that they can trust it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Products</h2>
<p>
    We develop a mobile sensor shield that accurately detects, tracks and localizes enemy movements. We primarily focus on aerial threats from autonomous systems such as FPV drones or terminally guided loitering munition.
</p>

<h2>Interface Support</h2>
<p>
    Our ambition is to support most standard interfaces used today my NATO allies.
