<!-- Swiss is a bold Jekyll theme inspired by Swiss design and the works of Massimo Vignelli. This theme lends itself well to sites heavy on written content.

### Features:

* Designed for blogs and sites heavy on written content, with bold typography styles, homepage summaries, and previous/next snippets.
* Supports a wide range of HTML elements and markdown.
* Flexible styles that can be reused for customization without adding additional CSS.
* Simple styling for code snippets (if you want something with syntax highlighting, checkout ....)
* Dynamically generated navigation links. See docs below for adding pages with specific post category for-loops.
