DroneDome is working on a next-gen solution for effectively protecting troops and assets from unmanned attacks. 

### Our philosophy:
* Interoperability: Our first priority is to be easy to use and quick to set up. We support the SAPIENT standard.
* Reliability: Our equipment is made to be sit in the mud for 2 weeks and still work.
* Accuracy: If users will need the help of our system, we do our best so that they can trust it.

## Products

We develop a mobile sensor shield that accurately detects, tracks and localizes enemy movements. We primarily focus on aerial threats from autonomous systems such as FPV drones or terminally guided loitering munition. 

## Interface Support

Our ambition is to support most standard interfaces used today my NATO allies.
